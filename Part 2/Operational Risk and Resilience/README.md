## Readings

- Global Association of Risk Professionals. Operational Risk and Resilience (New York, NY: Pearson, 2022).
	- Chapter 1. Introduction to Operational Risk and Resilience
		- Describe an operational risk management framework and assess the types of risks that can fall within the scope of such a framework.
		- Describe the seven Basel II event risk categories and identify examples of operational risk events in each category.
		- Explain characteristics of operational risk exposures and operational loss events, and challenges that can arise in managing operational risk due to these characteristics.
		- Describe operational resilience, identify the elements of an operational resilience framework, and summarize regulatory expectations for operational resilience.
	- Chapter 2. Risk Governance 
		- Explain the Basel regulatory expectations for the governance of an operational risk management framework.
		- Describe and compare the roles of different committees and the board of directors in operational risk governance.
		- Describe the “three lines of defense” model for operational risk governance and compare roles and responsibilities for each line of defense.
		- Explain best practices and regulatory expectations for the development of a risk appetite for operational risk and for a strong risk culture.
	- Chapter 3. Risk Identification
		- Discuss different top-down and bottom-up approaches and tools for identifying operational risks.
		- Describe best practices in extreme risk identification for operational risk.
		- Describe and apply an operational risk taxonomy and give examples of different taxonomies of operational risks.
		- Describe and apply the Level 1, 2, and 3 categories in the Basel operational risk taxonomy.
	- Chapter 4. Risk Measurement and Assessment
		- Explain best practices for the collection of operational loss data and reporting of operational loss incidents, including regulatory expectations.
		- Explain operational risk-assessment processes and tools, including risk control self-assessments (RCSAs), likelihood assessment scales, and heatmaps.
		- Describe the differences among key risk indicators (KRIs), key performance indicators (KPIs), and key control indicators (KCIs).
		- Describe the use of factor-based models that quantitatively assess operational risk, and explain the application of the Swiss cheese model and the bowtie tool.
		- Estimate operational risk exposures based on the fault tree model given probability assumptions.
		- Describe approaches used to determine the level of operational risk capital for economic capital purposes, including their application and limitations.
		- Describe and explain the steps to ensure a strong level of operational resilience, and to test the operational resilience of important business services.
	- Chapter 5. Risk Mitigation
		- Explain and compare different ways firms address their operational risk exposures.
		- Compare different types of internal controls and provide examples of each type of internal control.
		- Describe control automation, internal control design, and control testing, including risks and challenges that arise in these processes and ways to make them more effective.
		- Describe methods to improve the quality of an operational process and reduce the potential for human error.
		- Explain how operational risk can arise with new products, new business initiatives, or mergers and acquisitions, and describe ways to mitigate these risks.
		- Identify and describe approaches firms should use to mitigate the impact of operational risk events.
		- Describe methods for the transfer of operational risks and the management of reputational risk, and assess their effectiveness in different situations.
	- Chapter 6. Risk Reporting
		- Identify roles and responsibilities of different organizational committees, and explain how risk reports should be developed for each committee or business function.
		- Describe components of operational risk reports and explain best practices in operational risk reporting.
		- Describe challenges to reporting operational risks, including characteristics of operational loss data, and explain ways to overcome these challenges.
		- Explain best practices for reporting risk exposures to regulators and external stakeholders.
	- Chapter 7: Integrated Risk Management
		- Describe the role of risk governance, risk appetite, and risk culture in the context of an enterprise risk management (ERM) framework.
		- Explain and differentiate between regulatory capital and economic capital requirements as prescribed in Basel regulations.
		- Describe the elements of a sound stress-testing framework for financial institutions and explain best practices for stress testing.
		- Explain challenges and considerations when developing and implementing models used in stress testing operational risk.
- “Cyber-resilience: Range of practices”, Basel Committee on Banking Supervision Publication (December 2018). 
	- Chapter ?
		- Define cyber-resilience and compare recent regulatory initiatives in the area of cyber-resilience.
		- Describe current practices by banks and supervisors in the governance of a cyber-risk management framework, including roles and responsibilities.
		- Explain methods for supervising cyber-resilience, testing and incident response approaches, and cybersecurity and resilience metrics.
		- Explain and assess current practices for the sharing of cybersecurity information between different types of institutions.
		- Describe practices for the governance of risks of interconnected third-party service providers.
